# The some-pubs of Christmas

Come one come all to this years installment of, not Twelve, but 🎅🎅 SOME Pubs of Christmas 🎄🎄.
 
Have the _most_ fun by joining us at 🚉Farringdon🚉 at 4pm or have _some_ fun by joining anywhere else along the way 🚏. Last year a good strong number of people lasted right to the end having 👋 greeted and 👋 bid farewell to others just popping in to say hello.
 
Fourty-five🕘 minutes per pub including travel time🚏, and most of them are very close together. After some pubs have been visited we'll hit up the timeless classic o2 Academy Islington for some cheesy fun 🕺💃 until the wee hours.

This isn't an enforced beer-a-thon 🍺, you just come be social and drink whatever the hell you like.
