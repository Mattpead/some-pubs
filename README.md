# The some-pubs of Christmas

Come one come all to this years installment of, not Twelve, but SOME Pubs of Christmas.
 
Have the most fun by joining us at Farrington at 4pm or have some fun by joining anywhere else along the way.
 
Fourty-five minute per pub including travel time, and most of them are very close together. After some pubs have been visited we'll hit up the timeless classic o2 Academy Islington for some cheesy fun untitl the wee hours.
 
Schedule (subject to last minute adjustments, no blame is assumed for closed pubs or people lost along the way).
